            <div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item"><p>Here we arrive at the tricky part, because I want to share my own experience while also acknowledging that it’s not a blueprint for change: it’s simply how I transformed the structures of my own life. When the lockdown started, like many of us, I suddenly had a lot of extra time on my hands. So I started spending a lot more time walking barefoot in the grass, like I did as a child, and playing guitar by the campfire. I was rediscovering nature through my senses—gazing at the stars, listening to the birds at dawn, touching the bark of a tree, and getting dirt under my fingernails in the garden. As I did those things, I began to feel a strong call to cut back even further from my responsibilities, to have even more time free for wandering. I negotiated to cut back at work, and move from full-time employment to 3 days a week. This wasn’t an easy decision, because I knew it would force further changes. We would need to re-negotiate the financial aid at my son’s college, and we’d have to sell the house (since we’d no longer be able to service two mortgages and all the other debt we were carrying to support our lifestyle).</p>

<p>Fast-forwarding two years to the present moment, I can see that the structures of my life have changed dramatically. I’m now debt free. I have four-day “weekends” every week. My relationship to my wife of 23 years is deepening and transforming dramatically, and we’re closer than we’ve ever been. None of these things have been easy, but by taking one step at a time, and keeping the goal in sight, it’s been manageable.</p>

<p>One way I could summarize this goal—the compass I’ve been following—would be to simply look for aspects of my life where I see and feel scarcity, and instead seek to foster an experience of abundance. Looking back over the moments for which I hold the most regret in my life, I can easily see the powerful role that my experience of scarcity was playing in my psyche at those moments. How much of my life has been spent worrying that I had too little money, too little time, or too little love? Far more than I care to admit, even to myself.</p>

<p>Moving from the prison of scarcity into the field of abundance is not a single moment. It’s a process of learning to see the world, and our relationship to it, in new ways. We support that effort through conscious practices, such as taking on fewer responsibilities, changing our relationship to money, and looking for daily moments to be grateful for, over and over. At the end of the day, we can lie in bed and celebrate the small wins from that day: the moment we remembered to take a deep breath just before yelling at a loved one, the way we noticed the light and shadows playing on the earth as the clouds swept across the sky, or the moment we were feeling insecure about our future and remembered how many times we were fearful and everything worked out. As we awaken each morning, we can take a moment to remember Pachamama, and spend a few minutes in silence next to a favorite tree or gazing walking in the garden.</p>

<p>The habits of scarcity, for most of us, are supported by strong networks of neurons that have been firing together for many years. Day by day, however, we help our mind and body to build new pathways that become stronger as we continue. And as we experience that unfolding process, we see that the small, flickering flame of hope is growing. Eventually, I believe, we can begin to see that the fire we’ve been tending has grown bright enough to attract others, and to kindle their fires as well. That, for me, is a hopeful vision that I can get behind, and one that I also believe Pachamama is inviting us to embrace. <em>Do your work,</em> she says. <em>It is time. </em>And,<em> I’ve got you…you are not alone.</em></p>

Go ahead and try it. I’ve never been successful, and I’m not sure it’s possible. The inverse, of course, is also true. When “negative” emotions take root, it can be very hard to feel their opposite. It’s as if we have two basic energetic tracks in our mind/bodies: the “positive” emotions like happiness, joy, gratitude, love, etc., and the “negative” ruts of anger, frustration, hurt, fear, etc. From this dualistic paradigm, it’s easy to imagine an answer that is both simple and attainable: I’ll just cultivate the positive emotions and let go of the negative ones.</div>

Most of us are living lives of quiet desperation, trapped in the matrix despite seeing our plight. Knowing is not enough. The structures that we need to support the new world still mostly exist in the minds and hearts of our future selves.</div>

As with all true loves stories, the winding path of our lives together has spanned breathtaking mountain vistas as well as excruciating dark valleys. Surprisingly, and completely unpredictably, we recently passed through one of these shadowy places. In the impenetrable darkness of that long and lonely night, we could barely imagine dawn's arrival. And yet, we are now standing together in the sun's resplendent light, blinking in wonder at our heart's capacity to forgive, to change, to heal, and to embrace the profound mystery of sovereignty.</div>
