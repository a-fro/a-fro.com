On a glorious winter’s day<br />
Sun warming our faces<br />
Naked trees smiling down.</p>

<p>Look, it’s the white stag!<br />
She exclaims, staring in wonder<br />
At the bare limbs of the majestic Sycamore.<br />
Her radiant smile ignites my tinder heart.</p>

<p>Behind us, a stretch of shadows<br />
Blankets the forest floor<br />
Cast by the low winter sun,<br />
And two decades of parched longing.</p>

<p>We are learning to drink again.<br />
Moisture beads on our cracked lips.<br />
We have a long way to go,<br />
Even as we dance in this new arrival.</p>

<p>Love, watering this dry, dusty soil.<br />
Life, sprouting from ancient, cast away seeds.<br />
Had we pulled the tether of our deep roots<br />
We might have found our way back long ago.</p>

<p>Instead, we wandered,<br />
Alone, afraid, resentful and aching.<br />
In the darkness, we found a silent strength<br />
That could carry us through the night.</p>

<p>By daylight, we learned to move,<br />
Footfall by slow footfall,<br />
Never realizing our vast arcs<br />
Might lead us back together.</p>

<p>Under this bright winter sun,<br />
With the forest as our witness<br />
We smile and gaze into pools,<br />
Both long forgotten, and newly discovered.</p>

It is soul-sucking work, not because it is inherently bad or wrong, but because every fiber of my being knows that I am called to something much more aligned with Life. Most of us are living lives of quiet desperation, trapped in the matrix despite seeing our plight. Knowing is not enough. The structures that we need to support the new world still mostly exist in the minds and hearts of our future selves.</div>

If you have children, perhaps you remember the moment when you first held your newborn. In that liminal time, your heart sang and called out its reminder for you to live from your greatness—your best self. If you don't have children, perhaps you remember the experience that unfolded after the death of a loved one. My first touch of death happened when I was 9, and my cousin, David, died after a tragic battle with leukemia. He was only 6, but the love and openness he shared during his short life touched many people. Even at that young age, I remember thinking about how my life would be different because of him. I deeply yearned grow into a person whose life would express the fullness of this gift we've been given. Death and birth are two experiences that can open the window of our hearts, and let the breezes flow through and enliven our spirits.</div>

My office space, originally built as a temporary partition, had become a long-term work "environment" that I experienced as dark, stale and lifeless. As a web developer, I yearned to spend less time in front of a computer and more time outdoors.  I set up a part-time remote work arrangement, in part because I couldn't fathom spending 5 days a week there. Inspiration struck, however, and I found a way to not only transform my lifeless space, but also my experience of work and life itself. I now look forward to going to work most days, and smile every time I open the door to the sight and smell that awaits me upon arriving to my office.</div>
